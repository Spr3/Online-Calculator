# HTML_Calculator
I have made a Calculator that can do basic math. The Calculator can have multiple equations at once (EXAMPLE: "1+1*12-1="). I am working on adding Pemdas, Square Root and parentheses to the equation. The webpage is a typing and not just buttons. For the website to work the user has to input at least two numbers, an equals sighn and at least 2 symbles. The Symbols that can be used are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
